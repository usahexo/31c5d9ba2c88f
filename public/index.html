<h1 id="What-are-the-effects-of-addiction"><a href="#What-are-the-effects-of-addiction" class="headerlink" title="What are the effects of addiction?"></a>What are the effects of addiction?</h1><p>Addiction is a complex condition that has a wide range of effects on an individual’s life. Addicts may experience negative consequences in their personal relationships, at work or school, and in their financial situations.

<p>At work or school, addiction can lead to poor performance and missed days. Addicts may also be more likely to get into accidents due to impairment from drugs or alcohol. Financial difficulties are common among addicts, as they often spend large amounts of money on drugs or alcohol.</p>
